# FESS Technology Review

A living review repository for Flywheel Energy Storage System (FESS) technologies, cataloging topologies, performance metrics, efficiency, lifecycle, and environmental impact.

## Project Purpose

This repository serves as a dynamic, collaborative "living review" of different Flywheel Energy Storage System (FESS) technologies. It focuses on cataloging topologies, their performance metrics, efficiency, lifecycle considerations, and environmental impact. The goal is to create an open-access resource that can be continuously updated and peer-reviewed by the research community.

## Repository Structure

```
/technologies/          – Individual markdown files on each FESS type.
/data/                  – Data tables or CSV files comparing metrics.
/applications/          – Markdown files detailing specific use cases (UPS, FACTS, etc.).
/environmental-impact/  – Analyses on lifecycle and sustainability.
```

## Contribution Guidelines

1. **Issues**: Each FESS topology review begins as a GitHub Issue with a checklist of required information.
2. **Branches**: Create a new branch from `main` for each contribution (e.g., `add/steel-rotor-review`).
3. **Content**: Add or modify markdown files in the appropriate directory.
4. **Pull Requests**: Open a Pull Request (PR) to merge your branch into `main`. Reference the corresponding issue (e.g., "Closes #1").
5. **Review Process**: All PRs undergo peer review via GitHub's code review interface. Reviewers may request clarifications, suggest improvements, or point out missing citations.
6. **Merging**: Once approved, PRs are merged using a "Squash and merge" strategy to keep commit history clean.
7. **Updates**: The repository is a living document—existing content can be updated as new research emerges.
